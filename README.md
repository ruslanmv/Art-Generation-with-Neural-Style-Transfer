# Art-Generation-with-Neural-Style-Transfer
## Coursera - CNN Programming Assignment



Welcome! 
In this lab assignment, we will learn about Neural Style Transfer, an algorithm created by Gatys et al. (2015).

Upon completion of this assignment, we will be able to:

1. Implement the neural style transfer algorithm <br>
2. Generate novel artistic images using your algorithm <br>
3. Define the style cost function for Neural Style Transfer <br>
4. Define the content cost function for Neural Style Transfer <br>
5. Most of the algorithms you've studied optimize a cost function to get a set of parameter values. With Neural Style Transfer, we'll get to optimize a cost function to get pixel values. Exciting!
